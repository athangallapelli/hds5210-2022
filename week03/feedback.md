# Week 03 Feedback

In 14.3, you are overwriting the value of the input parameters, making them unusable anywhere else in the function and making the code a bit confusing.

In 14.4, you don't make that same mistake. However, you do rewrite all the same code again instead of just calling your LACE() function.

In 14.5, you use variable names like risk_1, risk_2, etc.  While not incorrect, from a best practices perspective, that's discouraged. If you can, let the variable name make it know what risk_1 is for... resp_rate_score or something like that.

I deducted 2 points for these style considerations.
