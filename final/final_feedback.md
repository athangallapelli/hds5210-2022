# Feedback on Final

Nice work overall. Your final project was generally easy to follow from start to finish. A few notes:
* Part of the project was to use functions to demonstrate abstraction and encapsulation. Don't create functions just for the sake of satisfying a requirement, though.  For example, what is the value of a function called `remove_nan()` that just calls `df.dropna()`?
* The goal of this program is to focus on health related data. Your project is interesting, but misses the mark on real-world application (especially in healthcare)

Consider what this kind of analysis leads you to understand about the relationship between different variables. "So what?" is a good question to ask yourself as a next step.

Great job!
